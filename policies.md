# Team Policies

### Meeting Times
We will be via Zoom  
Every Tuesday and Thursday, meetings will be from 3-5 PM  
During these meeting, we will talk about:  
```
What needs to be done
Time frame
How are things going
etc.
```
### Work

I believe in equal work among partners; everyone will be given the same amount of work  
Depending on others' specialties in certain areas, 
some may be subjected to more specific tasks, but the expectation is
You are familiar with the work we do, so we can revise and review each other's work  
__*Reviewing*__ is a requirement, and you will be asked to review multiple people's work

### Tools

Ideally, most of the projects will be done in JavaScript this allows us to have a collaboration function
allowing us to work on the same project and review it more easily.  
This will change depending on the tasks given to us  

### Disiplinary Actions

Since work is split evenly, you are expected to get your share of the work done in a timely manner.  
You are not the only person affected by your tardiness.  
If that affects our performance, a group decision will be made that could include termination from the project.

### Deliverables

I will handle the delivery of projects.  
Since we will mostly work on the same project on JavaScript it will simplify things where I can just deliver the finished project.  
In other cases, files should be zipped and emailed to me at @mccaikab@uni.edu.
