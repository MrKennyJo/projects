C0301 - Making sure that lines aren't too long makes it so your code 
is more easily read and makes it easier to catch mistakes. (horizontal scrolling sucks)

C0103 - Correctly named fuctions and variables seem very important it is also something that we have been taught since the
beginning of our journey of becoming software enginneers. It just provides more clarity and erases confusion.

W0611 - Unused imports just eliminated clutter and makes you code look better for reviewing and prevents unnecessary memory usage.

R0913 - Having a dictionary with all necessary arguments just allows your code to be cleaner. It is unnecessary to have too many 
arguments in one line of code it gets confusing and looks bad. passing a dictionary where it will just read the dictionary and it contains
what you need is more efficient.

E1101 - Creating classes or methods that tend to have no use in what you are trying to provide can lead to error in runtimes. Taking out unnecessary 
code/methods allows for less typos and runtime to be less especially when your method is calculating something you wont return.
